# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
This project was a part of the Android Developer Nanodegree, and involved the creation of a **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected. Sandwiches were initially provided in JSON format, and were then
parsed without the use of any libraries, before being displayed on the application.
